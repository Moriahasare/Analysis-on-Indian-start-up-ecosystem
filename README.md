## Project Overview
Welcome to my project, "Exploring Indian Startup Funding Trends." Here, I'll dive into the Indian startup scene from 2018 to 2021. Using Python and PowerBI, I'll analyze data to uncover key insights. Join me as we unravel the story behind startup funding in India. This repository has all the code and data files for this data analysis project, perfect for companies interested in the Indian startup ecosystem.

Features
The key attributes in the dataset include:

1. **Company/Brand**: Name of the company/start-up
2. **Founded**: Year start-up was founded
3. **Sector**: Sector of service
4. **What it does** : Description about Company
5. **Founders**: Founders of the Company
6. **Investor**: Investors
7. **Amount($)**: Raised fund
8. **Stage**: Round of funding reached

## Data sources 
The data for this project was sourced from Azubi Africa, offering access to information across three main components. The primary dataset, which includes data from 2020 and 2021, was securely stored in a remote database. The second dataset, focusing on 2019, was retrieved from OneDrive. Lastly, the dataset for 2018 was sourced from a GitHub repository and was provided in CSV format.

## Tools Used
- Python 
- Pandas   
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- PowerBI for visualizations and dashboards


## Exporatory Data Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is pivotal in unraveling the mysteries concealed within the Indian startup dataset. This phase involves delving deep into the data to unveil patterns, trends, and invaluable insights. I examine the data to understand its main characteristics, patterns, and relationships. The primary objective of this exploration is get answers to some analytical questions:

1. **At what stage do most startups receive funding?**

2. **Which year had the highest amount of startup funding?**

3. **What are the top 3 sectors receiving the highest funding amounts in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021?**

4. **How does the total funding amount vary over the years?**

5. **What are the top 5 sectors receiving the highest funding amounts?**

Checkout the notebook for answers to these analytical questions above.
